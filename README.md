# What's going on:
Safari in standalone mode on the ipad iOS 8.0, will not play video.

# Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load web page http://bugs.readingplus.com/ios8-video-test/
2. Add it to your home screen
3. Open the page via Home Screen Icon
4. Touch play controls to play video

# What should happen:
Video should play, it works on the evergreen browsers, and standalone mode on Android devices

# What really happens:
Only the first frame is shown O_o

# Thoughts:
There are no errors in the safari debug, and the video plays when launched when loaded straight from the safari browser.
